## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this smart contract is to establish a transparent and fraud-resistant supply chain tracking system by recording each step of the product's journey on the blockchain. It aims to enable stakeholders to trace the provenance of products from their origin to the final destination, thereby ensuring authenticity and reducing the risk of fraud.

### 1.2 Scope
This smart contract will be deployed on a blockchain network and can be accessed by various entities involved in the supply chain, including manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and consumers. The contract will provide a set of functions to manage the addition and tracking of products, as well as retrieve their status and history.

### 1.3 Audience
The primary audience of this documentation includes developers, auditors, and other stakeholders involved in the deployment and utilization of the smart contract.

### 1.4 Prerequisites
Before proceeding, ensure you have the following:
- Knowledge of blockchain technology and smart contracts.
- An Ethereum-compatible development environment (e.g., Truffle, Remix, or Hardhat) with access to a blockchain network.

## 2. Smart Contract Overview

### 2.1 Contract Name
SupplyChainTracker

### 2.2 Contract Description
The SupplyChainTracker smart contract allows participants to record product details and update their status as they move through the supply chain. Each product will be associated with a unique identifier, and its status will be updated at each significant step of the supply chain, such as manufacturing, packaging, shipping, and delivery.

### 2.3 Contract Features
- Addition of new products to the supply chain with relevant details.
- Updating the status of a product as it progresses through the supply chain.
- Retrieving the current status and historical tracking data of a product.

## 3. Contract Deployment

### 3.1 Environment Setup
Ensure that you have the required development environment set up, including an Ethereum wallet and access to a blockchain network.

### 3.2 Deployment Process
1. Compile the smart contract source code.
2. Deploy the compiled contract to the desired blockchain network using your preferred deployment tool or framework.

## 4. Contract Functions

### 4.1 `addProduct()`
**Description:** This function allows authorized participants to add a new product to the supply chain.

**Parameters:**
- `productId` (uint): A unique identifier for the product.
- `productName` (string): The name/description of the product.
- `manufacturer` (address): The Ethereum address of the manufacturer.
- `productionDate` (uint): The timestamp when the product was manufactured.

**Modifiers:**
- Access control to ensure only authorized entities can add products.

### 4.2 `updateProductStatus()`
**Description:** This function enables authorized participants to update the status of a product as it moves through the supply chain.

**Parameters:**
- `productId` (uint): The unique identifier of the product to update.
- `newStatus` (string): The new status of the product (e.g., "Manufactured," "In Transit," "Delivered").

**Modifiers:**
- Access control to ensure only authorized entities can update product status.

### 4.3 `getProductStatus()`
**Description:** This function allows anyone to retrieve the current status of a specific product.

**Parameters:**
- `productId` (uint): The unique identifier of the product.

**Returns:**
- `currentStatus` (string): The current status of the product.

### 4.4 `getProductHistory()`
**Description:** This function enables anyone to retrieve the complete history of a product, including all status updates.

**Parameters:**
- `productId` (uint): The unique identifier of the product.

**Returns:**
- `history` (string[]): An array of strings representing the historical status updates.

## 5. Contract Events

### 5.1 `ProductAdded`
**Description:** This event is emitted when a new product is successfully added to the supply chain.

**Parameters:**
- `productId` (uint): The unique identifier of the newly added product.
- `productName` (string): The name/description of the product.
- `manufacturer` (address): The Ethereum address of the manufacturer.
- `productionDate` (uint): The timestamp when the product was manufactured.

### 5.2 `ProductStatusUpdated`
**Description:** This event is emitted when the status of a product is successfully updated.

**Parameters:**
- `productId` (uint): The unique identifier of the product whose status was updated.
- `newStatus` (string): The new status of the product.

## 6. Security Considerations

### 6.1 Input Validation
Ensure that all input parameters are validated to prevent invalid or malicious data from being stored on the blockchain.

### 6.2 Access Control
Implement access control mechanisms to restrict the `addProduct()` and `updateProductStatus()` functions to authorized participants only.

### 6.3 Gas Optimization
Optimize the contract to minimize gas consumption by avoiding expensive operations and unnecessary data storage.

## 7. Conclusion

### 7.1 Summary
The SupplyChainTracker smart contract provides a transparent and fraud-resistant solution for tracking the supply chain of products on the blockchain. It allows participants to add new products, update their status, and retrieve historical tracking data.

### 7.2 Future Improvements
- Integration with Oracles or IoT devices for automated product status updates.
- Implementing a more complex access control system, such as Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
- Enhancing gas optimization techniques for better contract efficiency.

Note: This documentation provides an overview of the smart contract for supply chain tracking. For a complete implementation, additional testing and security audits are recommended before deploying it in a production environment.
